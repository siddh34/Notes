## Economics

Economics is a study of rationing systems

It is the study of how scarce resources are allocated to fulfill the infinite wants of consumers

They can be divided as into

    1. Micro (Small scale)
    2. Macro (Large scale)

    or 

    1. Planned Economies (Planned economics is a type of economic system where the distribution of goods and services or the investment, production and the allocation of capital goods takes place according to economic plans that are either economy-wide or limited to a category of goods and services)
    2. Free Market Economies (Free market economies are economic systems based on supply and demand with little or no government control)

## Factors of productions

    1. Land
    2. Labour
    3. capital
    4. Entreprenurship (Defining systems and processes, adoption of new technology)

Note: **Scarcity divides resource into free or a resource with cost**

## Demand and supply

Note: *Demand talks about affordability and supply talks about profitability*

What is Demand?

    People needy of something!

The factors affecting demand

        1. The prices of other good including substitutes and complements (PO)
        2. Aggregate consumer money income (M)
        3.  Consumer population (POP)
        4. Non economical factor including social, physiological and demographic factors unique to consumer in the market (SPPD)

Formula of demand is -->
**Qd = f(P | PO POP M SPPD)**

Change in demand

    Shift in position of demand curve

**How change in demand occurs?**

    1. Movement of the demand curve (Change in quantity demanded)
    2. Change in demand directly
    3. Change occurs when the demand curve constant changes suddenly

The Shift in demand: When POP changes

    1. With an increment in POP, The demand curve shifts from left to right
    2. The quantity demanded increases for all prices.

The Shift in demand: Non economical factor

    1. Consider the consumption trend moving away from foods that are preceived to be high in fat and cholestrol content
    2. This can be thought of as change in one component of SPPD

    Note Demand shifters (POP,PO,SPPD,M)

Shift in demand: Price of other goods

    1. With an increases in price of substitute, the demand curve shifts to right
    2. Other substitute main product price is affected
    3. Example prices of non-veg foods

How demand is controlled?

    1. Wealth effort
    2. Interest rate
    3. Foreign exchange

## Concept of Engineering Economics

* The engineering economics is concerned the systematic evaluation of the benefits and costs of projects involving engineering design and analysis

### Engineering Efficiency

* Engineering efficiency is the ratio between the energy needed to power an engine or process and the energy the engine or process creates

* The greater the engineering efficiency ratio, the more efficient the process

* Engineering efficiency also means measuring the output of work compared to the expected outcome

* Engineering efficiency is a combination of improving developer experience, maintaining org tempo, and staying aligned with business needs

### Economic efficiency

* Economic efficiency is when all goods and factors of production in an economy are distributed or allocated to their most valuable uses and waste is eliminated or minimized

* A system is considered economically efficient if the factors of production are used at a level at or near their capacity

* Economic efficiency implies an economic state in which every resource is optimally allocated to serve each individual or entity in the best way while minimizing waste and inefficiency

## Scope of engineering economics

* The engineering economics is concerned the systematic evaluation of the benefits and costs of projects involving engineering design and analysis

* Engineering economics quantifies the benefits and costs associating with engineering projects to determine if they save enough money to warrant their capital investments

* Engineering economics requires the application of engineering design and analysis principles to provide goods and services that satisfy the consumer at an affordable cost

* Engineering economics is also relevant to the design engineer who considers material selection

## Cost

While speaking about **Cost** can have two meanings:

* Money
* Resource/Requirement

Cost is affected by

* Factors of production
* Benefits of the product

Types

1. Explicit

        a. They are actually recorded 

2. Implicit

        a. Not recorded
        b. Intangible

3. Opportunity/Alternative Cost

        a. Forgone cost in which we do not invest but were willing to invest that amount is called as Opportunity/Alternative Cost
        b. It is second best investment option

4. Accounting Cost

        a. Refers only to money.
        b. Anything that is brought by giving the money and have a record is called as accounting cost
        c. All  Explicit cost are accounting cost
        d. Example interest on loans

5. Depreciation Cost

        a. Asset cost goes on decreasing that cost is depreciation cost
        b. Example depreciation cost in electronics is 33% per year
        c. It depends on the depreciation rate set by govt and the current financial year

6. Marginal Revenue and Marginal Cost

    The marginal cost of production and marginal revenue are economic measures used to determine the amount of output and the price per unit of a product that will maximize profits.
