### GDP (Gross Domestic Product)

        ii. Walling (< 10%)
        iii. Running (10% - 20%)
        iv. Galloping (20% - 100%)
        v. Hyper ( < 100%)
    Note: From point h to k belongs to types of inflation
    h. Cost pushed infilation (When resources to produce becomes costly)
    i. Monetary push (Increase in money leads to inflation in society)
    j. Skewflation (Rise in only certain product/ Timily rise in prices of certain products)
    k. Stagflation (Demand decreases + Unemployment + price increases)

NOTE: **Base year for calculation of taxes is 2011-2012**

How *Measuring Inflation* works?

    a. PPI (Product Price Index)
        i. Only about cost of product
    b. WPI (Wholesale Price Index)
        i. Price of wholesale market
        ii. Weighted indice 
        iii. Includes: Food (64%), Fuel (22%), Goods (13%)
    c. CPI (Consumer Price Index)
        i. Cost of consumer products
        ii. Includes: Food (45%), Fuel

B. Deflation

    a. Decrease in prices to lead to same life
