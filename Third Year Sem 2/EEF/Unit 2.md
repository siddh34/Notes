## National Income

* It is also used in macroeconomic models to determine things like the level of employment and inflation.

* There are several ways to measure national income. The most common method is the GDP approach, which simply adds up all of the final services and goods produced in an economy. Another common method is the income approach, which adds up all of the incomes of the factors of production

* National Income Formula

        Y = C + I + G + (X-M)

        where

        Y = national income

        C = consumption

        I = investment

        G = government spending

        X = exports

        M = imports.

* National Income Includes

        GDP & GDP with cost factor

        GNP & GNP with cost factor

        NNP (Net National Product)

        b.investments

        c.Gearing

        d.Profitability

## GDP is affected by

1. Investment
2. Government spending
3. Net exports
4. Consumption

## The Nature of the effects

### When prices lower

* The *Wealth* effect --> Due to more money in hand people consume more thus GDP increases

* The *Interest* effect --> It decreases

* Export effect  -->  Export increases

As a result GDP increases

### When prices increases

* The *Wealth* effect --> less wealth in hand

* The *Interest* effect --> It increases

* Export effect  -->  Export decreases

## GDP Types

### Real GDP

    1. Does not considers the time value of money
    2. More Accurate than nominal GDP

### Nominal GDP

    1. Does not considers the time value of money
    2. Less Accurate than real GDP

## Year on Year development

* The development of companies are in yearly quaters


## Inflation & Financial Ratios

A. Inflation

    a. Lets see the concepts of 
        i. Time value of money e.g compound interest
        ii. Annuity e.g transport vehicles has to pay taxes annually.
    b. Increase in prices to lead the same life style is inflation
    c. Inflation of 8% is good for nationa may lead to overall growth of nation's economy
    d. cheap loans -> money -> D > S -> price rises
    e. Continuous rise in inflation leads to decrease in purcasing power
    f. Limits 2% to 6% (Creeping change)
    g. Inflation categorized
        i. Creeping (2% - 6%)
        ii. Walling (< 10%)
        iii. Running (10% - 20%)
        iv. Galloping (20% - 100%)
        v. Hyper ( < 100%)
    Note: From point h to k belongs to types of inflation
    h. Cost pushed infilation (When resources to produce becomes costly)
    i. Monetary push (Increase in money leads to inflation in society)
    j. Skewflation (Rise in only certain product/ Timily rise in prices of certain products)
    k. Stagflation (Demand decreases + Unemployment + price increases)

NOTE: **Base year for calculation of taxes is 2011-2012**

How *Measuring Inflation* works?

    a. PPI (Product Price Index)
        i. Only about cost of product
    b. WPI (Wholesale Price Index)
        i. Price of wholesale market
        ii. Weighted indice 
        iii. Includes: Food (64%), Fuel (22%), Goods (13%)
    c. CPI (Consumer Price Index)
        i. Cost of consumer products
        ii. Includes: Food (45%), Fuel

* CPI Example

  ![Img](./Images/CPI.png)

* Inflation rate

        A. Inflation rate = ( Change in price index / Initial price index ) x 100

        B. example, CPI in 2001 = 177.1, CPI in 2000 = 172.2,

        C. IR = ( ( 177.1 - 177.2 ) / 177.2 ) x 100 = 2.8 % 

* Compounding effect

        A. Each year’s inflation rate is based on the previous year’s rate

        B. Example (Averge inflation is used here which will be explained further)

    ![Img](./Images/Compunding%20effect.png)

* Average inflation rate

    ![Img](./Images/average%20inflation.png)

        By observation we can construct simple formula like F = P (1 + f)^N

        where, 
        P is Principle amount
        F is compound value 
        f is avg inflation
        N is period

B. Deflation

    a. Decrease in prices to lead to same life

### GDP (Gross Domestic Product)

    a. Domestic means location dependent and whatever income/assets are in the region are counted in GDP
    b. GDP = C + I + G + (X-M) + Income by foreign national - Income by national aboard

### GNP (Gross National Product)

    a. National means the nations assets regardless of location
    b. GNP = C + I + G + (X-M) - Income by foreign national + Income by national aboard

### Cost Factor

    a. MRP
        i. if tax are added prices of things goes up
        ii. if subsidiaries are given then prices goes down
    b. GDP cost factor = GDP - Indirect Taxes + subsidiary
    c. Same can be applied for GNP

### NNP

    a. NNP = GNP - Depreciation
    b. NDP = GDP - Depreciation
    c. NDP with cost = GDP Cost Factor - Depreciation
    d. NNP with cost = GNP Cost Factor - Depreciation

### Percapita Income

    a. PCI = GDP / Population

### Personal Income (PI)

* This is NI minus corporate income taxes plus transfer payments. Transfer payments are payments made by the government to individuals that do not require the recipient to provide any good or service in return.

* The formula for PI: PI = GDP – NIT (where NIT=net indirect taxes).

### Disposable Income (DI)

* This is PI minus personal income taxes
