## Indian Economic

* India is a developing nation and economy, including a blended economy on the planet.
The significant attributes of a developing economy are overpopulation, the most extreme populace underneath the destitute or poverty line, a poor infrastructure, an agro-based economy, a slower pace of capital development, and low per capita income.

* Characteristics of the Indian Economy

        1. Low Per Capita Real Income
            i.The actual revenue or income of a nation alludes to the buying force or the purchasing power of the nation overall in a given monetary year,

        2. High Rate of Population Growth
            i. Where there is a high populace, There additionally must be a framework set up to help that populace

        3. The Endless Loop of Poverty. 
            i.The endless loop of neediness and poverty deals with both the supply side just as the demand side

## National Income

* It is also used in macroeconomic models to determine things like the level of employment and inflation.

* There are several ways to measure national income. The most common method is the GDP approach, which simply adds up all of the final services and goods produced in an economy. Another common method is the income approach, which adds up all of the incomes of the factors of production

* National Income Formula

        Y = C + I + G + (X-M)

        where

        Y = national income

        C = consumption

        I = investment

        G = government spending

        X = exports

        M = imports.

* National Income Includes

        GDP & GDP with cost factor

        GNP & GNP with cost factor

        NNP (Net National Product)

## GDP is affected by

1. Investment
2. Government spending
3. Net exports
4. Consumption

## The Nature of the effects

### When prices lower

* The *Wealth* effect --> Due to more money in hand people consume more thus GDP increases

* The *Interest* effect --> It decreases

* Export effect  -->  Export increases

As a result GDP increases

### When prices increases

* The *Wealth* effect --> less wealth in hand

* The *Interest* effect --> It increases

* Export effect  -->  Export decreases

## GDP Types

### Real GDP

    1. Does not considers the time value of money
    2. More Accurate than nominal GDP

### Nominal GDP

    1. Does not considers the time value of money
    2. Less Accurate than real GDP

## Year on Year development

* The development of companies are in yearly quaters

## Inflation & Financial Ratios

A. Inflation

    a. Lets see the concepts of 
        i. Time value of money e.g compound interest
        ii. Annuity e.g transport vehicles has to pay taxes annually.
    b. Increase in prices to lead the same life style is inflation
    c. Inflation of 8% is good for nationa may lead to overall growth of nation's economy
    d. cheap loans -> money -> D > S -> price rises
    e. Continuous rise in inflation leads to decrease in purcasing power
    f. Limits 2% to 6% (Creeping change)
    g. Inflation categorized
        i. Creeping (2% - 6%)
        ii. Walling (< 10%)
        iii. Running (10% - 20%)
        iv. Galloping (20% - 100%)
        v. Hyper ( < 100%)
    Note: From point h to k belongs to types of inflation
    h. Cost pushed infilation (When resources to produce becomes costly)
    i. Monetary push (Increase in money leads to inflation in society)
    j. Skewflation (Rise in only certain product/ Timily rise in prices of certain products)
    k. Stagflation (Demand decreases + Unemployment + price increases)

NOTE: **Base year for calculation of taxes is 2011-2012**

How *Measuring Inflation* works?

    a. PPI (Product Price Index)
        i. Only about cost of product
    b. WPI (Wholesale Price Index)
        i. Price of wholesale market
        ii. Weighted indice 
        iii. Includes: Food (64%), Fuel (22%), Goods (13%)
    c. CPI (Consumer Price Index)
        i. Cost of consumer products
        ii. Includes: Food (45%), Fuel

* CPI Example

  ![Img](./Images/CPI.png)

* Inflation rate

        A. Inflation rate = ( Change in price index / Initial price index ) x 100

        B. example, CPI in 2001 = 177.1, CPI in 2000 = 172.2,

        C. IR = ( ( 177.1 - 177.2 ) / 177.2 ) x 100 = 2.8 % 

* Compounding effect

        A. Each year’s inflation rate is based on the previous year’s rate

        B. Example (Averge inflation is used here which will be explained further)

    ![Img](./Images/Compunding%20effect.png)

* Average inflation rate

    ![Img](./Images/average%20inflation.png)

        By observation we can construct simple formula like F = P (1 + f)^N

        where, 
        P is Principle amount
        F is compound value 
        f is avg inflation
        N is period

B. Deflation

    a. Decrease in prices to lead to same life

### GDP (Gross Domestic Product)

    a. Domestic means location dependent and whatever income/assets are in the region are counted in GDP
    b. GDP = C + I + G + (X-M) + Income by foreign national - Income by national aboard

### GNP (Gross National Product)

    a. National means the nations assets regardless of location
    b. GNP = C + I + G + (X-M) - Income by foreign national + Income by national aboard

### Cost Factor

    a. MRP
        i. if tax are added prices of things goes up
        ii. if subsidiaries are given then prices goes down
    b. GDP cost factor = GDP - Indirect Taxes + subsidiary
    c. Same can be applied for GNP

### NNP

    a. NNP = GNP - Depreciation
    b. NDP = GDP - Depreciation
    c. NDP with cost = GDP Cost Factor - Depreciation
    d. NNP with cost = GNP Cost Factor - Depreciation

### Percapita Income

    a. PCI = GDP / Population

### Personal Income (PI)

* This is NI minus corporate income taxes plus transfer payments. Transfer payments are payments made by the government to individuals that do not require the recipient to provide any good or service in return.

* The formula for PI: PI = GDP – NIT (where NIT=net indirect taxes).

### Disposable Income (DI)

* This is PI minus personal income taxes

## Ratios & Numericals on them

* Formulas

        1. Current assets are: Liabilities x Current ratio

        2. liquid ratio = (current asset - equities)/(current liabilties)

        3. Closing stock + opening stock = closing equity

        4. Current ratio = current asset/curent liabilities

        5. Avg collection = debtors/ credit sales x 365

        6. stock turn over = cost of good sold / average stock

        7. working capital = current asset - current  liabilities

## Numericals

Q1. cost of good sold is 4 Lakh adminstrative expense. The distributed expense is 45 K net credit sales 475000 cash flows 125000 Find percentage of operating profit & operating profit ratio

    Answer:
    Sales = 400000
    Admin = 35000
    Selling = 45000
    Credit score - 475000
    cash sales

    operating profit = 600000 - 480000
    = 120000

    Operating profit ratio = OP/sales x 100 = 20 %

Q2. liabilities are 150000. Current ratio is 3:1 & the liquid ratio is 1:1. The value of stock will be?

    Answer
    liabilities = 150000
    liquid ratio = 1:1
    current ratio = 3:1

    current assets are: liabilities x current ratio
    current assets = 450000

    liquid ratio = (current asset - equities)/(current liabilties)

    stock = 300000

Q3. Total sales is 300000.The gross profit ratio is 20 %. Stock turn over is 6 times. The closing equity is 4000 more than opening equilty. Find opening equity

    Answer:
    Total sales = 300000
    Gross profit = 20% = 60000
    stock turn over is 6 times

    Closingvstock = 4000 - opening stock
    cost of good sold = sales - profit
    cost of good sold = 240000

    average stock = 240000/6
    averge stock = 40000

    average stock = (opening stock + closing stock)/2

    equation will be

    40000 = (x + x + 4000)/2
    x = 36000

Q4. Current Ratio 2:5. Liquid ratio is 1:5 the working capital is 75 K. Find the value of equity or stock

    Answer:
    Current ratio = 2.5
    Current ratio = current asset/curent liabilities
    working capital = 75K

    working capital = current asset - current  liabilities

    ca =2.5cl

    wc = ca - cl

    wc = 2.5cl - cl

    wc = 1.5cl

    75000 = 1.5cl

    cl = 50000

    wc = ca - cl

    75000 = ca - 50000
    ca = 125000

    cr = (ca - equilty) / cl
    1.5 = 125000 - eq / 50000
    1.5 x 50000 = 125000 - eq
    eq = 125000 - 1.5 x 50000
    eq = 50000

Q5. The opening equilty is 29 K. The closing equity and closing stock 31 K. Total purchase 242000. Find stock turn over ratio

    Answer
    Opening eq = 29000
    closing eq = 31000

    stock turn over = cost of good sold / average stock

    cost of good = purchase + opening stock - closing stock

    cost of good = 242000 + 2

    cost of good = 244000

    avg stock = 29 + 31 / 2 = 30

    stock turn over = 244000 / 30000

Q6. Credit sales of a company for years is 12 lakh. The debtors at the end of yaer is 240000. Find avg collection period assuming 365 days in years

    Answer

    Avg collection = debtors/ credit sales x 365

    avg collections = 240000/1200000 x 365

    avg collection = 73 K

Q7. The working capital is 1 lakh current ratio 3:1. Find current assets

    Answer

    Current ratio = ca/cl

    3 = ca / cl

    3 x cl = ca

    wc = ca - cl 

    100000 = 2ca

    50000 = ca

Q8. Prepaid expenses are 0. Current ratio 2.5 liquid ratio 1.5  find current liabilities if equity or stock is 4000

    Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities

    We are given that:

    Current Ratio = 2.5 Current Assets = Prepaid Expenses + Equity or Stock Prepaid Expenses = 0 Equity or Stock = 4000

    Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

    2.5 = (0 + 4000) / Current Liabilities

    Solving for Current Liabilities, we get:

    Current Liabilities = (0 + 4000) / 2.5 Current Liabilities = 1600

    Therefore, the current liabilities are 1600.
