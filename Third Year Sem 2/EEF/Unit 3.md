## Numericals

Q1. cost of good sold is 4 Lakh adminstrative expense. The distributed expense is 45 K net credit sales 475000 cash flows 125000 Find percentage of operating profit & operating profit ratio

    Answer:
    Sales = 400000
    Admin = 35000
    Selling = 45000
    Credit score - 475000
    cash sales

    operating profit = 600000 - 480000
    = 120000

    Operating profit ratio = OP/sales x 100 = 20 %

Q2. liabilities are 150000. Current ratio is 3:1 & the liquid ratio is 1:1. The value of stock will be?

    Answer
    liabilities = 150000
    liquid ratio = 1:1
    current ratio = 3:1

    current assets are: liabilities x current ratio
    current assets = 450000

    liquid ratio = (current asset - equities)/(current liabilties)

    stock = 300000

Q3. Total sales is 300000.The gross profit ratio is 20 %. Stock turn over is 6 times. The closing equity is 4000 more than opening equilty. Find opening equity

    Answer:
    Total sales = 300000
    Gross profit = 20% = 60000
    stock turn over is 6 times

    Closingvstock = 4000 - opening stock
    cost of good sold = sales - profit
    cost of good sold = 240000

    average stock = 240000/6
    averge stock = 40000

    average stock = (opening stock + closing stock)/2

    equation will be

    40000 = (x + x + 4000)/2
    x = 36000

Q4. Current Ratio 2:5. Liquid ratio is 1:5 the working capital is 75 K. Find the value of equity or stock

    Answer:
    Current ratio = 2.5
    Current ratio = current asset/curent liabilities
    working capital = 75K

    working capital = current asset - current  liabilities

    ca =2.5cl

    wc = ca - cl

    wc = 2.5cl - cl

    wc = 1.5cl

    75000 = 1.5cl

    cl = 50000

    wc = ca - cl

    75000 = ca - 50000
    ca = 125000

    cr = (ca - equilty) / cl
    1.5 = 125000 - eq / 50000
    1.5 x 50000 = 125000 - eq
    eq = 125000 - 1.5 x 50000
    eq = 50000

Q5. The opening equilty is 29 K. The closing equity and closing stock 31 K. Total purchase 242000. Find stock turn over ratio

    Answer
    Opening eq = 29000
    closing eq = 31000

    stock turn over = cost of good sold / average stock

    cost of good = purchasse + opening stock - closing stock

    cost of good = 242000 + 2

    cost of good = 244000

    avg stock = 29 + 31 / 2 = 30

    stock turn over = 244000 / 30000

Q6. Credit sales of a company for years is 12 lakh. The debtors at the end of yaer is 240000. Find avg collection period assuming 365 days in years

    Answer

    Avg collection = debtors/ credit sales x 365

    avg collections = 240000/1200000 x 365

    avg collection = 73 K

Q7. The working capital is 1 lakh current ratio 3:1. Find current assets

    Answer

    Current ratio = ca/cl

    3 = ca / cl

    3 x cl = ca

    wc = ca - cl 

    100000 = 2ca

    50000 = ca

Q8. Prepaid expenses are 0. Current ratio 2.5 liquid ratio 1.5  find current liabilities if equity or stock is 4000
