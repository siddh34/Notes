## Downsides of Disruptive Fintech Initiatives

1. As the technologies advance, so too do hackersâ€™ abilities and resources.
2. The nature of attackers has grown. They are highly organized. In some
   cases, they might even be nation-states.There are substantial risks for the
   industry. Fintech initiatives might suffer from the risks involved with them.
3. Fintech initiatives have deep risks connected with regulations
4. In the case of fintech initiatives, national borders are less relevant
   from a technology point of view, but regulatory agencies on all sides are keeping a close watch.
5. This is true especially for international sovereignty aspects, legal
   jurisdiction, customer data protection, and taxation.
6. While regulators with risk management on their agenda currently are
   a perceived barrier to fintech initiatives, the expectation is to see a
   higher level of coordination among the financial services, fintech
   companies, and regulatory officials.
7. It might even be a disaster to stifle such a
   promising industry change at this stage of development.
8. For example, the South Korean government realizes that fintech
   initiatives are changing the nature of financial services.30 The
   industry there is highly regulated, and the government worries about
   the viability of its existing banking infrastructure going forward
