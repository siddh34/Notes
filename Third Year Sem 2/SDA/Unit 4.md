# Unit 4 Aspect-Oriented Architecture

## MDA (Model Driven Architecture)

1. MDA model driven architecture is an approach to software design, development and implementation that uses models to express the specifications of a system at different levels of abstraction. MDA separates the business and application logic from the underlying platform technology, allowing the system to be realized on various platforms using different technologies

2. MDA is an initiative of the Object Management Group (OMG), which provides standards and guidelines for structuring software specifications using models. Some of these standards are UML, MOF, XMI, and CWM

3. MDA aims to improve the productivity, portability, interoperability, and maintainability of software systems by using models as the primary artifacts of software development

4. MDA also supports model-driven engineering, which is a broader discipline that applies modeling techniques to various domains and engineering processes

## Benefits

Some of the benefits of using MDA are:

* It can improve the productivity of software development by allowing developers to focus on the business logic and functionality rather than the technical details and platform dependencies

* It can enhance the portability and interoperability of software systems by enabling them to be realized on different platforms using different technologies, such as Web Services, .NET, CORBA, J2EE, etc.

* It can increase the maintainability and evolvability of software systems by allowing the business and technical aspects to change independently and at their own pace, without affecting each other.

* It can support model-driven engineering, which is a broader discipline that applies modeling techniques to various domains and engineering processes, such as analysis, design, testing, verification, validation, etc
