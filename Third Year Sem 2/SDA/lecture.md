## Clint server architecture

Client: The one who requests

Server: It receives the request & replies the client

Middlewares are in between client

There are different types of client models

Thick/fat client models

    Server is the incharge of data

Thin client models

    Applications processing & data management is carried out by server

## DBMS Architecture

* The simple architecture is client server & database

2nd-tier

* Based on client server architecture application directly interact with database

3rd-tier

* Contains presentation layer, application layer & database

* It is more scalable
