## MDA

### Basic concepts of MDA

1. Model: Combination of drawing & text

2. Viewpoint: here 'abstraction' is used to mean the process of suppressing selected detail

3. Platform: Set of subsystems

4. Prevasive services: services available in a wide range of platforms

### Types of viewpoints MDA

1. Computational Independant Viewpoint

        It focuses on environment of system

2. Platform Independent Viewpoint

        It focuses on Operations of system

3. Platform Specific Viewpoint

        It is linked to specific technology of platform

### Types of MDA

1. Computational Independant Model (CIM)

        1. A Computational Independent Model (CIM) is a model of a software or business system that defines its functionality and requirements from a business perspective, without considering any specific implementation details or technologies
        2. A CIM may contain information about the system’s organization, roles, functions, processes, activities, documentation, constraints, etc
        3. A CIM is one of the primary models defined within the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) approach proposed by the Object Management Group (OMG)

2. Platform Independent Model (PIM)

        1. A PIM is a model that describes the system’s functionality and behavior in a platform-independent way, using concepts that are independent of any specific technology or implementation

3. Platform Specific Model (PSM)

        1.  A PSM is a model that describes the system’s functionality and behavior in a platform-specific way, using concepts that are linked to a specific technology or implementation
        2.  This way, the system can be developed in a more abstract and platform-independent way, and then refined and implemented for different platforms in a more automated and consistent way
