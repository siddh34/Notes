## What is devops?

    1. DevOps is a software development practice that promotes collaboration between development and operations, resulting in faster and more reliable software delivery
    2. Commonly referred to as a culture, DevOps connects people, process, and technology to deliver continuous value
    3. DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development and IT operations using various tools and stages, such as planning, coding, testing, deploying and monitoring
    4. DevOps is an evolution of the agile model of software development and addresses the gap between developers and operations

### Code + Build

    NPM, Github, Gitlab, NodeJS etc are used

### Test

    Azure

### Release

    Jetkins

### Deploy

    Puppet, chef etc

### Operate

    Slack, splunk etc

### Monitor

    Grafana, graylogs etc

## Devops Roadmap

1. Version Control System

    1. A version control system is a software tool that helps track and manage changes to software code over time
    2. Version control systems also facilitate collaboration among developers, as they can work on different parts of the code without conflicting or overwriting each other’s work

2. Continuous Integration & deployment

    1. Continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) are two related practices that aim to improve the software development and delivery process
    2. CI is the practice of integrating code changes from multiple developers into a main repository frequently and automatically, and running automated tests to ensure quality and compatibility

3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

    1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a method of defining and provisioning IT infrastructure using code files that describe the desired state and configuration of the resources
    2. IaC enables developers and IT teams to automate and scale the creation and management of infrastructure, such as servers, networks, storage, and databases

4. Configuration management

    1. Configuration management (CM) is a process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a product’s performance, functional, and physical attributes with its requirements, design, and operational information throughout its life
    2. In software development, configuration management is a practice that tracks and controls changes to the software code and its dependencies, such as libraries, frameworks, and configuration files

5. Containerization

    1. Containerization has two distinct meanings. In computing, containerization is a method of packaging software code with only the operating system libraries and dependencies required to run it, creating a single lightweight executable unit called a container
    2. Containers can run on any infrastructure, regardless of the operating system or platform, and are more portable and resource-efficient than virtual machines

6. Observability/ Monitoring

    1. Observability and monitoring are related but distinct concepts that help IT teams to understand and manage the performance and health of their systems. Monitoring is the act of collecting and analyzing predefined data from individual systems, such as metrics, logs, and traces, and translating them into actionable insights
    2. Monitoring tools use dashboards, alerts, and reports to show system performance and usage, and help IT teams to identify or troubleshoot issues

Note: Linux should be perfect

## Devops Skills

DevOps skills are the technical and non-technical abilities that a DevOps engineer needs to perform their role effectively.

* Automation skills

    1. Automation skills are the skills that enable a DevOps engineer to automate various aspects of the software development and delivery process, such as testing, integration, deployment, and monitoring. Automation skills include knowledge of tools and frameworks that support automation, such as Jenkins, GitLab, Azure DevOps, and Travis CI

* Functional Skills

    1. Functional skills are the skills that enable a DevOps engineer to understand the business requirements and goals of the software project, and to communicate and collaborate effectively with other stakeholders. Functional skills include knowledge of agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, that support DevOps principles

* Technical skills

    1. Technical skills are the skills that enable a DevOps engineer to design, develop, deploy, and maintain high-quality software applications. Technical skills include knowledge of cloud computing platforms and services, such as AWS, GCP, and Azure
