# Unit 1 **Agile Methodology**

1. The *Agile software development is group of software development methods based on iterative and incremental* where requirments and solution was through collaboration between self organizing cross functional teams.

2. *Agile software development promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, timebox iterative approach* and encourages rapid and flexinle response to change

## History of Agile

    a. Some developers reacted against the traditional ways of developing software
    b. New methods were dveloped and tested
    c. "Representatives" from several of these methods got together in Utah in 2001. They termed it as "Agile" and called themselves as "Agile Alliance. Later they developed a manifesto

## Theories for Agile Management

Why Agile?

    1. Making changes was hard
    2. No focus on clients
    3. Hard to measure project progress
    4. Until end of project, no working software is released or produced
    5. Wasn't suitable for long and ongoing project

Agile Process model

    "Agile process model" refers to the Software development based on iterative development
    
    "Agile" is much swift and versatile than traditional software development methods

Phases of Agile Model:

    1. Requirement gathering
    2. Design requirements
    3. Construction and iteration
    4. Testing
    5. Deployment
    6. Feedback

1. Traditional vs Agile Model

    | Traditional | Agile |
    |-------------|-------|
    |In traditional approach estimates once done are not revised| Agile estimates and plans are revisited in every iteration, which brings it more close to reality|
    |In traditional approach, the project manager will create a project plan for tasks with all the dependencies mapped out and team members assigned|It’s a complete team effort, complete team in involved|
    |Estimating in Traditional project management is usually task-based|Estimating in agile project management is typically feature-based, such as "find a flight by source and destination city," are estimated in their entirety|
    |Users are not involved much|Users are involved from the very beginning|
    | More towards Sequential | Iterative |

## Different Types of Agile Methodologies

1. The Kanban system

        a. The phrase ‘Kanban,' which comes from the Japanese language, means “visual board or signboard” and is linked to the concept of “just in time”! 
        b. Initially established as a lean manufacturing method, the Kanban concept has gradually found its way into agile software development teams. 
        c. This method develops and manages projects using visual methods
        d. Kanban projects are managed with the use of a Kanban Board, which is separated into columns to illustrate the software development process flow. 
        e. This increases team visibility by allowing them to see progress through each stage of production and prepare for impending activities in order to deliver the product "just in time"!

2. Scrum: A software development methodology

        a. The agile scrum development approach, which is portrayed through numerous development cycles, is one of the most common agile methodology examples. 
        b. Scrum, like Kanban, divides the development process into stages or cycles called sprints. Each sprint's development time is maximised and devoted, allowing only one sprint to be managed at a time. 
        c. Scrum and agile techniques emphasise ongoing deliverables, therefore this strategy allows designers to alter priorities to guarantee that any sprints that are incomplete or overdue receive further attention. 
        d. The Scrum Team has dedicated project responsibilities such as a scrum master and a product owner, with daily scrums where activities are harmonised to determine the best method to implement the sprint

3. XP (Extreme Programming)

        a. Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development process that prioritises collaboration, communication, and feedback. 
        b. It emphasises continuous improvement and client happiness. This strategy, like scrum, makes use of sprints, or short development cycles. This is created by a group of people in order to produce a productive and efficient workplace
        c. In Extreme Programming, the project is tested from the beginning by gathering input that improves the system's output. This also serves as a spot check to ensure that any consumer requests are easily implemented.
        d. In a circumstance where clients have frequent and fluctuating expectations, the Extreme Programming technique comes in handy.

4. Crystal

        a. Crystal is a series of smaller agile development approaches that include Crystal Yellow, Crystal Clear, Crystal Red, Crystal Orange, and more, and was introduced by Mr Alistair Cockburn, one of the key figures in establishing the Agile credo for software development. 
        b. Each has its own unique structure, which is defined by criteria including system criticality, team size, and project priorities. 
        c. The type of crystal agile methodology is chosen according to the nature of the project or system criticalities, such as Comfort (C), Essential Money (E), Discretionary Money (D), and Life (L). Crystal, like other Agile approaches, focuses on timely product delivery, regularity, minimal administration with high user interaction, and customer satisfaction. 
        d. The Crystal family believes that each system or project is unique, necessitating the use of a variety of techniques, processes, and policies to obtain the best results, giving them the title of agile methodology's lightest approaches.

5. Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)

        a. The Dynamic Systems Development Method was created in response to the demand for a common industry charter for the rapid delivery of software. 
        b. DSDM provides a comprehensive structure that can be developed and adjusted to plan, execute, manage, and expand software development processes. 
        c. The DSDM believes that project modifications should always be expected, and quality and timely delivery should never be negotiated, based on a business-driven strategy and eight principles.

6. Lean

        a. Although it is a deeply adaptive, evolving methodology with the absence of fixed principles, laws, or techniques.
        b. It is an iterative, agile methodology that leads the team on addressing client values through persuasive value stream mapping
        c. In comparison to the hierarchical flow of control, Lean offers each individual and small team decision-making authority

    The **Core Lean Principles** are

    * Uninterrupted advancement
    * Respect for other people
    * Eradicate waste
    * Rapid delivery
    * Knowledge-making and
    * Defer commitment

## Agile Manifesto and Principles

Manifesto for **Agile Software Development**

        Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
        Working software over comprehensive documentation
        Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
        Responding to change over following a plan

The **Agile principles**

        a. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. 
        
        b. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

        c. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

        d. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

        e. Build projects around motivated individuals. 
        
        f. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

        g. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

        h. Working software is the primary measure of progress. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

        i. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

        j. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

        k. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

        l. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly

## Agile Project Management

    a. Definition: Agile project management is an iterative approach to software development projects and ensures feedback can be acted on quickly.
 
    b. The responsive changes can be made at each stage of a sprint or product cycle. 

    c. This allows project teams to adopt agile project management methodologies to work quickly and collaboratively within the timeframe and budget of a project.

## Agile Project Interactions

Iteractions can be done by,

        a. Face-to-Face: Face-to-face communication will usually be the most effective way of communicating, either with individuals or with a small-to-medium sized group (as a workshop or a meeting). 
        b. Conferencing: We can either use VC (Video conference) or Teleconference (Phone call)
        c. Chat facilities: For quick interchange of short pieces of information, this can be very effective
        d. Email: It is also an effective channel for broadcasting information to a large group where getting people together is not justifiable, provided email best practice is followed.
        e. Collaborative workspaces: Eg slack
        f. Documents: These are still important in DSDM, for capturing and managing more formal information and artefacts which need to be shared and managed, for example a risk log 

## Ethics in Agile Teams

    Commitment: 
        a. It's not enough to be assigned to a team and agree to try this new agile thing, and it's not enough simply to be dedicated. 
        b. One must also be committed to doing whatever is necessary to meet the goals outlined and to take the authority to do so to heart. 
        c. It means "to carry into action deliberately" (Merriam-Webster) or, as Yoda says, "Do, or do not. There is no try."

    Focus: 
        a. Don't get sidetracked. Remember what you committed to do, and focus your energies on fulfilling that promise. 
        b. Distractions are not limited to the obvious things like email and unrelated meetings. They may also be things like creating documentation

    Openness: 
        a. Openness is about keeping the project status highly visible to everyone all the time. 
        b. Anyone who is interested should be able to look at a wall, a wiki page, or a dashboard in an agile project management tool and see how many features have been completed, what's currently being worked on, and the goals of the iteration and release.
        c. Communication: People on the team must talk to each other. This gets harder to do the more geographically separated the team is, but with tools like Skype, teams can talk to one another easily and cheaply. 
        d. The point is that team members must not rely on email and documentation alone. Verbal communication is required to clarify ideas, solve complex problems, answer questions quickly, and help team members coordinate work efforts.

    Simplicity: 
        a. "What is the simplest thing that could possibly work?" Then they should do that thing. Because agile approaches develop code in increments each iteration, the thought is that it is better to develop something simple that may have to be expanded later if needed, rather than spend a large amount of time now developing a solution that's more complicated and may, in fact, not be necessary.

    Feedback: 
        a. As stated earlier, our number one obligation is to provide value to the customer. 
        b. In order to do that, we must obtain frequent feedback from the customer or customer representative in order to make sure that the product we are building is meeting their expectations. And if it is not, we have the information we need now in order to make corrections. 
        c. Extending this meaning of feedback to include feedback from the system itself in the form of unit, functional, and performance tests run frequently in each iteration.

    Courage: In order to accept the authority and accountability for the delivery of the product, the team members all need courage. From the courage to make decisions to the courage to say no, this is a foundational value that gives rise to all the others.

    Respect: 
        a. Each team member must begin by agreeing that everyone deserves to be treated with respect. 
        b. Many teams clarify this with working agreements that outline ways in which they choose to work together.

## Agility in Design and Testing

1. Agility in design

        a. Every team works differently, and many create their own workflow with practices borrowed from frameworks that have worked well for them in the past
        b. If your team is already practicing Scrum, transitioning to this approach should be fairly simple
        c. The idea here is to incorporate Scrum for the prototyping and testing part of the design thinking process

    ![Img 2](./Image/design.jpg)

2. Agility in testing

        a. Agile testing is an iterative and incremental method, and the necessities, which develop during the cooperation between the customer and self-establish teams
        b. In agile testing, the word "Agile" primarily signifies something that can be performed quickly and immediately, but also in the area of software development

    ![Img 3](./Image/testing.jpg)

        c. Let's see the principles
            i. Constant Response (The implementation of Agile testing delivers a response or feedback on an ongoing basis. Therefore, our product can meet the business needs)
            ii. Less Documentation (The execution of agile testing requires less documentation as the Agile teams or all the test engineers use a reusable specification or a checklist)
            iii. Continuous Testing (The agile test engineers execute the testing endlessly as this is the only technique to make sure that the constant improvement of the product)
            iv. Customer Satisfaction (In any project delivery, customer satisfaction is important as the customers are exposed to their product throughout the development process)
            v. Easy and clean code (When the bugs or defects occurred by the agile team or the testing team are fixed in a similar iteration, which leads us to get the easy and clean code)
            vi. Involvement of the entire team (As we know that, the testing team is the only team who is responsible for a testing process in the Software Development Life Cycle)
            viii. Test-Driven (While doing the agile testing, we need to execute the testing process during the implementation that helps us to decrease the development time)
            ix. Quick response (In each iteration of agile testing, the business team is involved. Therefore, we can get continuous feedback that helps us to reduces the time of feedback response on development work)

    ![Img 4](./Image/agiletestinglifecycle.jpg)

        d. Agile Testing lifecycle
            i. Phase1: Impact Assessment (we collect the inputs and responses from users and stakeholders to execute the impact assessment phase. This phase is also known as the feedback phase)
            ii. Phase2: Agile Testing Planning (The second phase of the Agile testing life cycle is agile testing planning.In this phase, the developers, test engineers, stakeholders, customers, and end-users team up to plan the testing process schedules, regular meetings, and deliverables)
            iii. Phase3: Release Readiness (The next phase of the Agile testing life cycle is release readiness, where test engineers have to review the features which have been created entirely and test if they are ready to go live or not and which ones need to go back to the previous development phase)
            iv. Phase4: Daily Scrums (Daily scrums are the next phase of the Agile testing life cycle, which involves the daily morning meetings to check on testing and determine the objectives for the day)
            v. Phase5: Test Agility Review (The last and final phase of the Agile life cycle is the test agility review. The test agility phase encompasses the weekly meetings with the stakeholders to evaluate and assess the progress against goals)

## Agile Documentations

        a. Agile Documentation Strategies
            i. Invest in quality over documentation. The better designed our solution is, the easier it will be for stakeholders to understand it, and therefore generally less documentation will be required
        b. Write documentation that is just barely good enough (JBGE). When we do create documentation it should be JBGE, or just barely sufficient, to fulfill the needs of our stakeholders and no more.
        c. Document stable concepts, not speculative ideas. Speculative ideas, such as requirements, are likely to evolve over time. This in turn requires you to update your documentation. Whenever possible, wait until the material that you are describing is stable before you capture it in documentation.
        d. Find better ways to communicate. If the purpose of a document is to communicate information to others, it is important to recognize that detailed documentation is one of the least effective means to accomplish that purpose. You have other communication options available to you to choose from.
        e. Recognize that you need some documentation. A common, and unfortunately enduring, misunderstanding about agile is that agile teams don’t write documentation.
        f. Work closely with stakeholders. The only way we can write effective documentation is if we know what our stakeholders need and how they will work with the documentation that we produce.

## Agile Drivers, Capabilities and Values

1. Agile Drivers

    ![Img 5](./Image/agile%20working%20drivers.jpg)

2. Agile Capabilities

        a. Capabilities exhibit the same characteristics and practices as features.
        b. they Are described using a phrase and benefit hypothesis
        c. Are sized to fit within a PI, however, they often take multiple ARTs to implement
        d. Are reasoned about and approved using the Solution Kanban
        e. The Solution Backlog holds approved capabilities ciated enablers to describe and bring visibility to all the technical work necessary to support efficient development
        f. Capabilities may originate in the local context of the solution or occur as a result of splitting portfolio epics that may cut across more than one Value Stream

3. Values

        Agile Values are:

            a. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
            b. Working software over comprehensive documentation
            c. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
            d. Responding to change over following a plan
