## Theories for Agile Management

Why Agile?

    1. Making changes was hard
    2. No focus on clients
    3. Hard to measure project progress
    4. Until end of project, no working software is released or produced
    5. Wasn't suitable for long and ongoing project

Agile Process model

    "Agile process model" refers to the Software development based on iterative development
    
    "Agile" is much swift and versatile than traditional software development methods

Phases of Agile Model:

    1. Requirement gathering
    2. Design requirements
    3. Construction and iteration
    4. Testing
    5. Deployment
    6. Feedback

1. Traditional vs Agile Model

    | Traditional | Agile |
    |-------------|-------|
    |In traditional approach estimates once done are not revised| Agile estimates and plans are revisited in every iteration, which brings it more close to reality|
    |In traditional approach, the project manager will create a project plan for tasks with all the dependencies mapped out and team members assigned|Itâ€™s a complete team effort, complete team in involved|
    |Estimating in Traditional project management is usually task-based|Estimating in agile project management is typically feature-based, such as "find a flight by source and destination city," are estimated in their entirety|
    |Users are not involved much|Users are involved from the very beginning|
    | More towards Sequential | Iterative |
