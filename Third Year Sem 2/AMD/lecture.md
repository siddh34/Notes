* Continuous Development

        Executable file is created after CD

* Continuous Integration

        Using Jetkins CI can be done

* Continuous Deployment

        Code is built, the environment or the application is containerized & is pushed on to the desired server

* Continuous Testing

        Integration tools send the failure message to developer or pushes the code to production

* Continuous Monitoring

        This stage monitors the deployed application for bugs or crashes. It also collects user feedback

* Some of benefits of devops are

    1. Faster delivery of features and bug fixes

    2. Higher quality and reliability of software

    3. Improved collaboration and communication among teams

    4. Reduced costs and risks of software development
