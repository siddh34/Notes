# Unit 4 Intractable Problems and NP-Completeness

Algorithm can be divided into two parts

1. Ploynomial time

        1) Linear Search
        2) Binary Search
        3) Insertion Sort
        4) Merge Sort

2. Exponential time / Non ploynomial time

        1) TSP
        2) GRAPH COLORING
        3) Sudoku
        4) Scheduling

## P Class Problem

A problem which can be solved in ploynomial time is called the P class problem

## NP Class Problem

* A problem which cannot be solved in ploynomial time but it is verified in ploynomial time is called the NP class problem

* Example SUDOKU

## Deterministic algorithm

    Problems where we know its every steps

## Non Deterministic algorithm

    1. Problems where we don't know its every steps

    2. Example

```Python
        TYC_SEARCH(A,N,KEY):
            i = choice()

            if(i == key)
                print(i)
            
            print(0)
```

Exact Diagram

![Img](./Images/np.png)

1. Inside P tractable problems are there

2. Inside NP non tractable problems are there

3. P is the class of problems that can be solved by a deterministic machine in polynomial time

4. NP is the class of problems that can be solved by a non-deterministic machine in polynomial time, or equivalently, verified by a deterministic machine in polynomial time given a certificate or a hint.

5. **NP-complete is the class of problems that are both in NP and as hard as any problem in NP**, meaning that **any problem in NP can be reduced to them in polynomial time**. Example eulers graph

6. **NP-hard is the class of problems that are at least as hard as any problem in NP**, meaning that **any problem in NP can be reduced to them in polynomial time, but they may or may not be in NP themselves.** Example optimization problem

The diagram also shows two possible scenarios for the relationship between P and NP

    1. The left side assumes that P â‰  NP, meaning that there are some problems in NP that cannot be solved by a deterministic machine in polynomial time. This is the most widely believed conjecture, but it has not been proven or disproven yet.
    2. The right side assumes that P = NP, meaning that there are no problems in NP that cannot be solved by a deterministic machine in polynomial time. This would imply that all problems in NP are also in P, and that all problems in NP-complete are also in P. This would have profound implications for cryptography, optimization, and artificial intelligence, but it is considered very unlikely by most experts.
